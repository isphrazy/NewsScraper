     <description>
      Recipients of student loans can breathe a little easier today as the house voted to keep interest rates low on government-sponsored Stafford loans.

The vote was 215-195 with 30 Republicans voting against and 13 Democrats voting for the bill.

     <title>Fast Food Companies Learning Not All Publicity is Good</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | I'm not sure when my disdain for fast food began. It might have been the first time I took a job in the industry and saw the behaviors of my fellow employees. It could have been from my experiences as a customer. But I know now when my distrust of these companies was cemented. I'll only eat fast food again if it's my only option.

     <title>Getting 'Draw Something' on the Kindle Fire is a Great Move</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Anyone who has an iPod, iPhone, iPad or Android-powered device has likely downloaded and played the app &quot;Draw Something&quot; by now since Mashable is reporting the game passed the 50 million download mark in 50 days. All the mania that surrounded the popular guess-what-I-drew extravaganza is only going to be amplified over the course of the next week or two.

     <title>Netflix is in Serious Trouble</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The recent stock price troubles of Internet video streaming giant Netflix are a prime example of the troubles facing the subscriber-based service. As WebProNews reports, Netflix shares have plummeted despite the company adding 3 million subscribers during the first quarter. Growth is slowing, which is worrisome, but doubts about Netflix's business model are also starting to creep up. The short story would be that Netflix is on its way out of the limelight.

     <title>Nondisclosure of Funds Insufficient Reason to Rejail Zimmerman</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to CNN, lawyers for Trayvon Martin's family are requesting George Zimmerman should be returned to jail for failing to disclose $204,000 in donations during his bond hearing. Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara indicated he would talk to a judge about them today. The donations are a contested issue because Zimmerman, as of the time he was granted bail, was believed by the court and O'Mara to have no noteworthy assets. The donations were submitted by Zimmerman supporters to his PayPal accounts.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Where else but in jolly old England can people who need to show up to their most-identified-by-the-public work site one of every four days receive good pay and generous perks? The Sun reported that over 75 days, Members of Parliament who debate and pass legislation in the House of Commons will have been in session for 19 days thanks to a number of long breaks.

     <title>Planetary Resources Will Have the Last Laugh</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It might seem something out of a science fiction movie, but the company recently launched by James Cameron, Larry Page and others called Planetary Resources is anything but a joke. According The Huffington Post, the company is going to mine asteroids for precious metals like platinum and gold and return them to Earth. But this is not just a way for a few ultra-rich people to burn some cash in the atmosphere.

     <title>Travel and Vacation Insurance Not Just for Overly Cautious</title>
     <description>
      When planning a vacation or any type of trip, planning for the unexpected does not usually jump directly into the picture. Travel insurance is something a lot of folks tend to skimp on. But Kaiser Health News reports that for a pretty small sum travelers can protect themselves from a variety of events that could affect the trip, including health emergencies, weather issues and missing a cruise due to a delayed flight. But as a news release from Squaremouth. ...

Air quality in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas ranked again among the worst in America.

     <title>Department of Labor: Stay Off Our Family Farms</title>

      COMMENTARY | While I was raised in a small town of 1,000 people in West Central Iowa, my family has a farm about a 30 minute drive away. Many summers were spent at the farm mowing, playing and gardening -- or what the Department of Labor might call, work. We thought it was fun.

     <title>Politics Goes Postal with Dueling Reform Bills</title>
     <description>
      The Washington Post reports the Senate has passed legislation that would save the U.S. Postal Service from its near-collapse. If a deal to cut expenses isn't reached by May 15, the postal agency will start closing more facilities unless Congress passes laws otherwise. The American institution is trying to save expenses as the amount of mail being delivered has decreased steadily over the past decade.

     <title>Determining Immigration Status Will Be Difficult for Arizona</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Reuters, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- the only Hispanic justice on the court -- was very active in Wednesday's oral arguments regarding the case of whether Arizona can enforce its illegal immigration law. And she made a very good point: It will be difficult to determine whether someone is an illegal immigrant or not. The difficulty is caused by lapses in the federal system. And it could cause people to end up waiting in jail for the government to determine their status.

      COMMENTARY| Over the winter the U.S. economy saw hiring pick up and unemployment decrease. However, as of last week, unemployment remained near a three-month high of 388,000, as reported by the Associated Press. New unemployment applications were expected to drop to 375,000. Instead, they are 13,000 applications higher than expected. That's not a good sign for the economy.

      COMMENTARY | Nadya Suleman, otherwise known as the Octomom, is making headlines once again. Her hairdresser allegedly leaked photos of the Suleman home that show a messy, disorganized home, according to ABC News. She appeared on Good Morning America to defend herself on Thursday, but the pictures sent a pretty clear message. The word &quot;squalor&quot; has been used to describe the home, but is it really as bad as some who have us believe?

      COMMENTARY | There is an arrogance assumed by many politicians that there is an exceptionalism about the U.S. that not only sets it apart from other nations but above them as well. Although it is used as some sort of indoctrination mantra the further right one goes, the declarative phrase &quot;Only in America&quot; is used liberally to denote whatever the politician happens to be talking about can only happen in the U.S.
