     <title>Glee Celebrates the T'</title>
     <description>
      It was a very special disco-themed episode of &quot;Glee&quot; on Fox the other night. A new character named Wade from a different high school shared that he was born in the wrong body. He was black, but he said he felt he was born white and decided to go out on stage at Regionals painted over as a white man. Everyone adored and applauded him as he sang &quot;Boogie Shoes&quot; looking just like the lead singer of KC and the Sunshine Band.

     <title>Carter Redux?</title>
     <description>
      Every new datum on economic stagnation — such as Thursday's Labor Department announcement that unemployment claims remain at a three-month high — increases the temptation to compare the 2012 presidential race to 1980's. Both years feature a Democratic incumbent, elected on a surge of high hopes, who must face the voters after four years of disappointment. In both cases, the economy is a drag on the president. In both cases, the incumbent has attempted to demonize his opposition in order to avoid running on his record. ...

     <title>Newt's Great Adventure</title>
     <description>
      Every four years, there is one presidential campaign that is much more fun to watch than the rest, even if it has no realistic chance of success. I loved watching Mike Huckabee four years ago. It was far better than watching John McCain going from the Straight Talk Express (fun four years before) to the cautious conservative.

     <title>Rubio's Lifeline</title>
     <description>
      Marco Rubio has thrown the GOP a lifeline; let's see whether his fellow party members are willing to grab it. The freshman U.S. senator from Florida has been a hard-line foe to illegal immigrants, both in his home state and since his election to Congress, but now he is considering drafting a new &quot;DREAM Act,&quot; which would offer legal status to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.
