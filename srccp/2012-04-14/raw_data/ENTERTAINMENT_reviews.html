His newest book begins where the first left off with a new goal of 90 days. But this time around, Clegg is not out to kill himself with endless sleep-deprived, paranoid nights on cocaine. Instead, it's an account of getting sober and a journey of relapse and recovery. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The former Washington Post editor and reporter and current New Yorker staff writer figured that if she couldn't escape calamity in her own home, she may as well do what she loved: report on poverty from one of its epicenters. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

All sorts of things can, and do, go bump in the night. Horror films like &quot;Silent House&quot; exploit the thin line -- at least for suggestible and susceptible viewers -- between creaky and creepy. &quot;Silent House,&quot; which is based on &quot;La Casa Muda,&quot; a 2010 Uruguayan film, does creepy with artistic pretentions. Written by Laura Lau and directed by Lau and Chris Kentis (the married couple's previous film was &quot;Open Water&quot;), this low-budget indie is filmed in a series of extended takes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Unless, of course, it involves an actor — even one as talented as the great Ruby Dee — actually saying out loud, &quot;Family is what's important,&quot; which is a cue to leave the theater and spend one's valuable time teaching a nephew to fly a kite rather than wasting two hours on another sanctimonious Hollywood feel-good movie. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - International best-selling novelist Lionel Shriver's latest book is released on Thursday, but it isn't exactly new. She wrote it over 10 years ago. &quot;The New Republic&quot; follows Shriver's best-selling works like &quot;The Post-Birthday World&quot; as well as &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin,&quot; the 2011 movie starring Tilda Swinton for which she was nominated for a best actress Golden Globe. ...

     <title>S&amp;P: China developers getting closer to &quot;downgrade thresholds&quot;</title>
     <description>
      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tough operating conditions and heightened refinancing risks in China's property market are pushing more developers closer to their downgrade thresholds, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said in a report on Thursday. In the report titled &quot;The Worst Is Yet To Come For Chinese Developers In Asia's Shaky Property Sector,&quot; S&amp;P warned that more credit downgrades are likely in the next six months. &quot;Many developers in China may be at increased risk of refinancing due to weaker property sales, high funding costs, and tightened liquidity. ...

     <title>Tim and Eric's &quot;Billion Dollar Movie&quot; worth about 15 cents</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - What's funny to one person is just a prolonged poop joke to another person. Not that there's anything wrong with scatological humor. &quot;Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie&quot; is full of it. Literally. The film, already available free on cable and opening theatrically on Friday, is going to appeal to a very limited audience. But for those on its wavelength -- I'm guessing mostly men, mostly younger -- it hits all of their requisite stations of the comedy cross. Joke about masturbation? Check. ...

All sorts of things can, and do, go bump in the night. Horror films like &quot;Silent House&quot; exploit the thin line -- at least for suggestible and susceptible viewers -- between creaky and creepy. &quot;Silent House,&quot; which is based on &quot;La Casa Muda,&quot; a 2010 Uruguayan film, does creepy with artistic pretentions. Written by Laura Lau and directed by Lau and Chris Kentis (the married couple's previous film was &quot;Open Water&quot;), this low-budget indie is filmed in a series of extended takes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>&quot;Awake&quot; Is the Best New Show of the Season</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - &quot;Awake&quot; is the best new show of the season. It isn't perfect. The NBC drama, debuting tonight, will confuse and perhaps occasionally bore you. But despite the most complicated narrative since ABC's &quot;Lost&quot; kept skipping through time, &quot;Awake&quot; makes a fast, emotional connection that gives viewers an almost immediate stake in the lives of its compelling characters. The basic setup is this: LAPD Det. Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is in a horrible car accident with his wife and son. It breaks his life in two. ...

When &quot;Grindhouse&quot; directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino were deliberately putting scratches and missing frames into their film to make it look like an old print from the 1970s, they were picking up tricks that Maddin was doing back in the '90s with early films like &quot;Careful&quot; and &quot;Archangel. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

When &quot;Grindhouse&quot; directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino were deliberately putting scratches and missing frames into their film to make it look like an old print from the 1970s, they were picking up tricks that Maddin was doing back in the '90s with early films like &quot;Careful&quot; and &quot;Archangel. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

His newest book begins where the first left off with a new goal of 90 days. But this time around, Clegg is not out to kill himself with endless sleep-deprived, paranoid nights on cocaine. Instead, it's an account of getting sober and a journey of relapse and recovery. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Book Talk: Deceit and espionage in darkest Luxembourg</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - The worst thing about Kate's life in Luxembourg as the trailing spouse of a man hired to work on banking security at first simply appears to be the boredom of spending days among fellow housewives after giving up her career. But Kate, the heroine of Chris Pavone's debut novel &quot;The Expats,&quot; is a former CIA agent who has never told her husband what she did. As she seeks both to escape her past deeds and become a new person, she starts to become suspicious not only of her husband Dexter's doings but those of a couple whose friendliness may not be quite what it seems. ...

But now we have Jennifer Westfeldt as the patron saint of safety, conformity and the dominant paradigm. Westfeldt, you may recall, wrote and starred in the wispy &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein,&quot; a comedy about a young woman frustrated with the dating scene who flirts with becoming a lesbian before getting all &quot;hmm, no thanks&quot; about it. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

But now we have Jennifer Westfeldt as the patron saint of safety, conformity and the dominant paradigm. Westfeldt, you may recall, wrote and starred in the wispy &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein,&quot; a comedy about a young woman frustrated with the dating scene who flirts with becoming a lesbian before getting all &quot;hmm, no thanks&quot; about it. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>S&amp;P: China developers getting closer to &quot;downgrade thresholds&quot;</title>
     <description>
      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tough operating conditions and heightened refinancing risks in China's property market are pushing more developers closer to their downgrade thresholds, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said in a report on Thursday. In the report titled &quot;The Worst Is Yet To Come For Chinese Developers In Asia's Shaky Property Sector,&quot; S&amp;P warned that more credit downgrades are likely in the next six months. &quot;Many developers in China may be at increased risk of refinancing due to weaker property sales, high funding costs, and tightened liquidity. ...

     <title>Tim and Eric's &quot;Billion Dollar Movie&quot; worth about 15 cents</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - What's funny to one person is just a prolonged poop joke to another person. Not that there's anything wrong with scatological humor. &quot;Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie&quot; is full of it. Literally. The film, already available free on cable and opening theatrically on Friday, is going to appeal to a very limited audience. But for those on its wavelength -- I'm guessing mostly men, mostly younger -- it hits all of their requisite stations of the comedy cross. Joke about masturbation? Check. ...

     <title>&quot;Awake&quot; Is the Best New Show of the Season</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - &quot;Awake&quot; is the best new show of the season. It isn't perfect. The NBC drama, debuting tonight, will confuse and perhaps occasionally bore you. But despite the most complicated narrative since ABC's &quot;Lost&quot; kept skipping through time, &quot;Awake&quot; makes a fast, emotional connection that gives viewers an almost immediate stake in the lives of its compelling characters. The basic setup is this: LAPD Det. Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is in a horrible car accident with his wife and son. It breaks his life in two. ...
