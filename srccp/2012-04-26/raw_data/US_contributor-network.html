     <title>Mein Kampf: Are We Returning to Germany's Dark Past?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the BBC, the German state of Bavaria is preparing to re-publish Mein Kampf, Hitler's now infamous manifesto. Although the book was never banned in Germany, Bavaria used its sole ownership of the copyright to prevent publication of German editions. As a result, the book has not been published in Germany since 1945.

     <title>Every Parent Has Been an 'Octomom' at Some Point</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It's in the news that &quot;Octomom&quot; Nadya Suleman is in the media fire for photographs leaked by her hairdresser that show her huge family living in not-so-favorable conditions. The photographs show Suleman's toddlers using the restroom outside and their residence covered with graffiti. Considering Suleman was just on &quot;Today,&quot; addressing the fact she recently signed up for food stamps (something she said she would never do), this is the last thing the woman needs.

     <title>Twice-Transplanted Kidney a First</title>
     <description>
      Ray Fearing's sister gave him the ultimate gift of life - one of her kidneys. Unfortunately, the disease that destroyed his own kidneys, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), attacked the new kidney as well, according to PR Newswire. The disease not only threatened the new kidney, it put Fearing's life in jeopardy. The only way to halt FSGS's destructive progression was to remove the kidney.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich is set to officially suspend his campaign next week.

     <title>Voters Already Know November Will Bring a Close Election</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The November election for the White House is months away still, and yet the analysts and hopefuls are already starting to circle the wagons with regards to the election. The Ticket is reporting that 100 electoral votes will decide the contest, because as the report reminds us it takes 270 electoral votes to win the majority. However, Americans do not need exhaustive coverage about a close election, because everybody pretty much knew that already.

     <title>Mitt Romney’s Presumptive GOP Nomination by the Numbers</title>
     <description>
      Mitt Romney still needs 300 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president ahead of his party's national convention. The front-runner sounded like a winner after five primary elections Tuesday. Romney insisted his general election campaign will be about a &quot;better America&quot; and will focus on differences between himself and incumbent Barack Obama. Romney's numbers in achieving presumptive nominee status might not be where he wants them. But he has cleared a major hurdle in his bid to be president.

     <title>Gingrich Concedes Race -- but Doesn't -- in Still Another Delaying Tactic</title>
     <description>
      The 2012 GOP presidential campaign will go down in history as one of the strangest. To add to that strangeness, chronic reality denier and one-time presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich told a group of supporters in North Carolina Wednesday that the real world had made Mitt Romney the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And yet, top aides told CBS News/National Journal he would officially concede to Romney on May 1.

     <title>Should I Worry About Mad Cow Disease in California?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As a resident of California, it doesn't make me particularly happy to hear that a case of mad cow disease has been found here. The Lookout suggests the food supply was not at risk, and the appropriate authorities handled the problem quickly. But even a cursory amount of worry can lead to a number of questions that will not necessarily have easy or quick answers. To start, is this story essentially over, or will we have problems in the future?

     <title>Young Voters Older, Wary</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It is no surprise younger voters, accustomed to &quot;American Idol,&quot; can be swayed by the glitz and glory of a single performance. President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was grandiose, invigorating and full of hope and change. It's no surprise young voters fell in love with and cast their vote for such a promising and charismatic man.

     <title>Oldest, Largest Fossil Found Near Cincinnati Remains Unidentified</title>
     <description>
      The Associated Press first reported on a rare fossil found in Northern Kentucky in 2011. The specimen remains unidentified due to its rarity. Geologists and paleontologists are just now getting a chance to look at the fossil to try to determine what it could be. Dubbed &quot;Godzillus,&quot; the mystery of the Cincinnati area's primordial seas just got a jolt from opening the ultimate cold case.

     <title>Even Marines Can't Escape the Consequences of Facebook Rants</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As social media has grown over the last several years, companies have had to create new policies and procedures regarding how to handle employees that misuse such outlets. It seems that even those serving in the military are not immune to the consequences, despite the fact that they are serving to protect our freedom. And, when a Marine sergeant tried to exercise his free speech via Facebook, he became an example of exactly what might happen when you take things too far.

     <title>Child Labor Ban Discriminatory, Reactionary</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Department of Labor is nearing completion on a proposal that would ban some forms of child labor on farms, The Daily Caller reports. It is drawing sharp criticism from families and children. While restrictions are aimed at keeping children safe and preventing exploitation, the measure is unfair, shortsighted and reactionary.

     <title>Why Republicans Want Us Stupid</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Once again, with a snotty misquote of President Barack Obama intended to make the president himself look petty, the Republicans say more than they think. Fox correspondent Steve Doocy admitted he &quot;paraphrased&quot; the president when claiming that Obama said, &quot;Unlike some people, I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.&quot; We'll get to what the president did say in a moment.

     <description>
      After last night's primaries, it appears that the GOP has decided to rally around its presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney.

     <title>Heart Attack Grill Exploits the Fattening of America</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As reported by the Huffington Post, a woman in her 40s collapsed while she ate a double bypass burger, drank a margarita and smoked a cigarette at the infamous Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas. Her recovery continues while hopefully she reconsiders her culinary choices. Two months ago, another customer died after eating a triple bypass burger at the same restaurant.

     <title>Gingrich Drop-out Leaves Voters with Romney as Republican John Kerry</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| &quot;It's clear Romney will be GOP nominee,&quot; Newt Gingrich told a room filled with North Carolina supporters. At the same time, the Associated Press reports that Gingrich plans to find ways to be helpful in the campaign to defeat President Barack Obama at the polls. Unless Ron Paul can pull an election rabbit out of the hat, Mitt Romney's nomination for the November ballot is virtually in the bag. It is doubtful that the Romney campaign will have a role for Gingrich after the latter officially suspends his campaign.

     <title>Ron Paul Supporters Need to Sober Up</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | And then there were two, sort of. With Rick Santorum suspending his campaign roughly two weeks ago and Newt Gingrich's recent announcement that he too will be dropping out, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney are the only competitors still standing … that is, if you consider Ron Paul's stubbornness and steadfast refusal to admit defeat in the face of impossible odds to be &quot;standing.&quot;

     <title>Ron Paul is Inspirational, Not Ignorant or Stubborn</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The 79 delegates won by Ron Paul are considered miniscule when compared to Mitt Romney's 844, according to the New York Times. While most voters have counted out the senior candidate, he should be looked at as an inspiration. Most candidates run for office with an ultimate goal of winning, but Paul has a message he believes is more important than the election.

     <title>Federal Government Doesn't Want to Know About Illegal Immigration</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to The Lookout, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts stated on Wednesday that it seems to him that the federal government just doesn't want to know who's here illegally or not. Indeed, it would seem that way, reading some of the oral arguments made this week to the Supreme Court in the case against Arizona's controversial illegal immigration law.

      The case of Pfc. Bradley Manning, who was accused of providing top secret military documents to WikiLeaks, is still ongoing. Today, the judge ruled on a motion by the defense to have all charges dismissed. Army Col. Denise Lind ruled the 22 counts could not be dismissed, according to the Associated Press.

     <title>At Last, Newt Gingrich Has Ended His Futile, Ego-Driven Campaign</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Newt Gingrich's bigheaded, narcissistic campaign for the Republican Party's nomination for president in 2012 is now, mercilessly, over. After losing badly in five primaries on Tuesday -- Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and most crucially, Delaware, a state that his campaign thought they had a chance to win -- Gingrich told a small group of his dwindling cadre of supporters that he was &quot;going to look realistically at where we are at&quot; in the campaign. Clearly this was a long overdue statement.

Or, in the rare case he or she does, is it publicly acceptable for them to do that? Still, does the public have the right to judge you on who you can and cannot forgive?

These laws were demonized by the left, including Rev. Al Sharpton, saying on MSNBC that &quot;this is the first time in 47 years we have seen such a frontal attack on the voting rights act.&quot; While there have been many studies and reports on the true impact of voter fraud, large and unsubstantiated claims from advocates have attracted more attention. ...

     <title>What Will Happen If the Supreme Court Backs Arizona on Immigration?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Illegal immigration is a complicated issue that doesn't seem to have a perfect solution, but the controversial Arizona immigration law is not the right answer.

     <title>Is the Economy Improving or Isn’t It?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| Over the winter the U.S. economy saw hiring pick up and unemployment decrease. However, as of last week, unemployment remained near a three-month high of 388,000, as reported by the Associated Press. New unemployment applications were expected to drop to 375,000. Instead, they are 13,000 applications higher than expected. That's not a good sign for the economy.

     <title>Has the Octomom Finally Proven Herself to Be an Unfit Parent?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Nadya Suleman, otherwise known as the Octomom, is making headlines once again. Her hairdresser allegedly leaked photos of the Suleman home that show a messy, disorganized home, according to ABC News. She appeared on Good Morning America to defend herself on Thursday, but the pictures sent a pretty clear message. The word &quot;squalor&quot; has been used to describe the home, but is it really as bad as some who have us believe?

     <title>What's Wrong with Saying 'Only in America?'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | There is an arrogance assumed by many politicians that there is an exceptionalism about the U.S. that not only sets it apart from other nations but above them as well. Although it is used as some sort of indoctrination mantra the further right one goes, the declarative phrase &quot;Only in America&quot; is used liberally to denote whatever the politician happens to be talking about can only happen in the U.S.

     <title>Obama Woos the Celeb-Smitten, but They Want Jobs</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Want a hipster in the White House? President Obama's pretty sure you do. In just four months, he's devoted quite a bit of time to all things celeb: he &quot;slow jammed the news&quot; with Jimmy Fallon, sang a clip from Al Green's &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; at Harlem's Apollo Theater, wrote a happy birthday letter to &quot;It Girl&quot; and indie rocker Zooey Deschanel, and recorded a minute-long video wishing Betty White a Happy 90th birthday that ends with him listening to the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; theme song on his iPod. Yes, we have a cool president.

     <title>The Los Angeles Riots Served as Inspiration for Many Musicians</title>
     <description>
      This weekend marks 20 years since the Los Angeles riots.
